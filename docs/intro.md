# Getting started
## Client-Server

## Embedded
Install EchoVault with: go get github.com/echoVault/echoVault. Run go mod tidy to pull all of EchoVault's dependencies.

Here's an example of using EchoVault as an embedded library. You can access all of EchoVault's commands using an ergonomic API.

Homebrew
To install via homebrew, run:

brew tap echovault/echovault
brew install echovault/echovault/echovault
Once installed, you can run the server with the following command: echovault --bind-addr=localhost --data-dir="path/to/persistence/directory"

Next, install the client via homebrew.

#### Binaries
You can download the binaries by clicking on a release tag and downloading the binary for your system.

### Clients
EchoVault uses RESP, which makes it compatible with existing Redis clients.
