a sorted set are multiplied by the corresponding weight in WEIGHTS. Aggregate determines how the scores are combined.
WITHSCORES option determines whether to return the result with scores included.`}

    `WEIGHTS - A list of floats that determine the weight of each sorted set. The scores of each member 
    of a sort set are multiplied by the corresponding weight. If weights are not provided, the default weight
    is 1 for all sorted sets.`,
    `AGGREGATE - Determines the strategy used to compare the scores of members in the union.
    SUM will add the scores, MIN will choose the minimum score, and MAX will choose the maximum score.`,
